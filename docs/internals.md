# Internals

## Script detection

The scanner detects Traditional vs. Simplified Chinese by counting exclusive characters. Variant rules (裏→裡, 着→著) are skipped for Simplified input. When detection is `Unknown`, variant rules still fire (conservative default).

## Processing pipeline

1. NFC normalization with byte-offset mapping
2. Content-type dispatch: Markdown (pulldown-cmark), YAML (key token exclusion), plain text (regex exclusion). `MarkdownScanCode` variant also lints inside fenced code blocks.
3. Inline suppression markers (`<!-- zhtw:ignore-next-line -->`, `<!-- zhtw:ignore-block/end-ignore -->`)
4. Spelling pass: dual Aho-Corasick automata (leftmost-longest for spelling, case-insensitive for case rules); context-clue AC pre-scan for rules with `context_clues` or `negative_context_clues`
5. Punctuation pass: full-width conversion, CN curly quotes, enumeration comma, quote hierarchy, CJK spacing
6. Variant pass: character variant normalization with exception phrase checking
7. Overlap resolution: longer match wins, higher severity on tie
8. Profile filtering (e.g., `臺`/`台` only in `strict`)
9. Sampling (optional): ambiguous terms escalated to host LLM

## Design decisions

- No async runtime by default. Synchronous stdio with background thread + mpsc for timeout-bounded sampling. Optional `--features async-transport` for tokio.
- Pure Rust, no C/C++ dependencies. MMSEG segmenter builds its dictionary from ruleset vocabulary at construction time.
- Byte-safe edits: positions from pulldown-cmark event ranges map back to original byte offsets.
- JSON ruleset (`assets/ruleset.json`) embedded via `include_str!`. Runtime overrides in platform config directory.
- SHA-256 trace IDs for reproducibility. No `uuid` crate dependency.
- Small release binary (~3 MB on x86-64 Linux, LTO + strip).
- Sampling (step 9) only activates when running as an MCP server inside an AI assistant. The standalone CLI skips sampling and keeps ambiguous issues at their original severity.
- Incremental scan cache (BLAKE3-keyed, 24h TTL, 2000-entry cap) skips re-scanning unchanged files in lint-only CLI mode. Disabled for `--fix`, `--verify`, and stdin. MCP path does not use the cache (stateless by design).
- Built-in SC→TC converter (`s2t.rs` + `s2t_data.rs`) eliminates the OpenCC runtime dependency for the `convert` subcommand.
- Anchor calibration (`translate.rs`) annotates ambiguous issues with `anchor_match: Option<bool>` (confirmed/unconfirmed/no-signal) via synonym table and LCP stem matching. Fails open on API error (severity preserved).

## Corpus evaluation

Synthetic corpus fixtures in `tests/corpus/` drive aggregate quality metrics.

- `ai-generated.json`: zh-TW technical prose with LLM-style filler and zh-CN drift.
- `native-zh-tw.json`: clean native-style zh-TW technical prose used for false-positive checks.
- `cn-to-tw-conversion.json`: zh-CN technical prose evaluated after built-in SC->TC conversion.

The corpora are synthetic and repeat short seed documents enough times to exceed 50 KiB per corpus during evaluation. The test harness (`tests/corpus-evaluation.rs`) treats each seed as an independent document, weighted by its `repeat` count.

Metric definitions:

- `precision`: true-positive issue matches / all reported issues on corpora with gold positives.
- `recall`: true-positive issue matches / all gold issues on corpora with gold positives.
- `false_positive_rate`: fraction of native zh-TW documents that produced one or more issues.
- `safe_fix_success_rate`: fraction of documents whose `lexical_safe` output exactly matches the expected fixed text.

Gate thresholds: precision >= 90%, false-positive rate <= 5% on native zh-TW, safe-fix success >= 85% on AI-generated corpus.

`expected_issues` and `expected_fixed` are intentionally independent: `expected_issues` lists all scanner detections (precision/recall), while `expected_fixed` reflects `LexicalSafe` fixer output (safe-fix rate). Confusable rules and clue-gated cross_strait rules are flagged by the scanner but skipped by the fixer, so some issues appear in `expected_issues` without a corresponding replacement in `expected_fixed`.

Run `make corpus` to print the metrics table locally.
